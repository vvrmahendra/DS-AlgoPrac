"""Buying Candies
Problem Description
Rishik likes candies a lot. So, he went to a candy-shop to buy candies.

The shopkeeper showed him N packets each containg A[i] candies for cost of C[i] nibbles, each candy in that packet has a sweetness B[i]. The shopkeeper puts the condition that Rishik can buy as many complete candy-packets as he wants but he can't buy a part of the packet.

Rishik has D nibbles, can you tell him the maximum amount of sweetness he can get from candy-packets he will buy?           


Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 700 1 <= A[i] <= 1000 1 <= B[i] <= 1000 1 <= C[i],D <= 1000  


Input Format
First argument of input is an integer array A
Second argument of input is an integer array B
Third argument of input is an integer array C
Fourth argument of input is an integer D


Output Format
Return a single integer denoting maximum sweetness of the candies that he can buy


Example Input
 Input 1:
 A = [1, 2, 3]
 B = [2, 2, 10]
 C = [2, 3, 9]
 D = 8
Input 2:
 A = [2]
 B = [5]
 C = [10]
 D = 99


Example Output
Output 1:
 10
Output 2:
 90
 


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 Choose 1 Packet of kind 1 = 1 Candy of 2 Sweetness = 2 Sweetness
 Choose 2 Packet of kind 2 = 2 Candy of 2 Sweetness = 8 Sweetness
Explanation 2:
 Buy 9 Packet of kind 1. 18 Candy each of 5 Sweetness = 90 Sweetness"""
