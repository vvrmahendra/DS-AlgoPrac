"""Check whether the graph is bipartite or not
Problem Description
Given a undirected graph having A nodes. A matrix B of size M x 2 is given which represents the edges such that there is an edge between B[i][0] and B[i][1]. Find whether the given graph is bipartite or not. A graph is bipartite if we can split it's set of nodes into two independent subsets A and B such that every edge in the graph has one node in A and another node in B Note: There are no self-loops in the graph. No multiple edges between two pair of vertices. The graph may or may not be connected. Nodes are Numbered from 0 to A-1. Your solution will run on multiple testcases. If you are using global variables make sure to clear them.   


Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 100000 1 <= M <= min(A*(A-1)/2,200000) 0 <= B[i][0],B[i][1] < A   


Input Format
The first argument given is an integer A. The second argument given is the matrix B.   


Output Format
Return 1 if the given graph is bipartide else return 0.


Example Input
Input 1:
A = 2
B = [ [0, 1] ]
  Input 2:          
A = 3
B = [ [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2] ]
      


Example Output
Output 1:
1
  Output 2:          
0
      


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
Put 0 and 1 into 2 different subsets.
  Explanation 2:          
 
It is impossible to break the graph down to make two different subsets for bipartite matching"""
