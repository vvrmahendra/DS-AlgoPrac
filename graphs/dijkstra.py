Problem Description
Given a weighted undirected graph having A nodes and M weighted edges, and a source node C. You have to find an integer array D of size A such that: => D[i] : Shortest distance form the C node to node i. => If node i is not reachable from C then -1. Note: There are no self-loops in the graph. No multiple edges between two pair of vertices. The graph may or may not be connected. Nodes are numbered from 0 to A-1. Your solution will run on multiple testcases. If you are using global variables make sure to clear them. 


Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 1e5 0 <= B[i][0],B[i][1] < A 0 <= B[i][2] <= 1e3 0 <= C < A 


Input Format
The first argument given is an integer A, representing the number of nodes. The second argument given is the matrix B of size M x 3, where nodes B[i][0] and B[i][1] are connected with an edge of weight B[i][2]. The third argument given is an integer C. 


Output Format
Return the integer array D.


Example Input
Input 1:
A = 6
B = [   [0, 4, 9]
        [3, 4, 6] 
        [1, 2, 1] 
        [2, 5, 1] 
        [2, 4, 5] 
        [0, 3, 7] 
        [0, 1, 1] 
        [4, 5, 7] 
        [0, 5, 1] ] 
C = 4
  Input 2:      
A = 5
B = [   [0, 3, 4]
        [2, 3, 3] 
        [0, 1, 9] 
        [3, 4, 10] 
        [1, 3, 8]  ] 
C = 4
    


Example Output
Output 1:
D = [7, 6, 5, 6, 0, 6]
  Output 2:      
D = [14, 18, 13, 10, 0]
