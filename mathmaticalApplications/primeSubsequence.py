"""Given an array A having N positive numbers. You have to find the number of Prime subsequences of A.

A Prime subsequence is one that has only prime numbers, for example [2, 3], [5] are the Prime subsequences where [2, 4] and [1, 2, 3, 4] are not.



Input Format

The first argument given is an Array A, having N integers.
Output Format

Return an integer X, i.e number of Prime subsequences. 
As X can be very large print X % (1000000007), here % is modulus operator.
Constraints

1 <= N <= 1e3
1 <= A[i] <= 1e6
For Example

Input:
    A = [1, 2, 3]
Output:
     3

Explanation:
    no. Subsequences      Prime subsequences
    1.  [1]                     No
    2.  [1, 2]                  No
    3.  [1, 3]                  No
    4.  [1, 2, 3]               No
    5.  [2]                     Yes
    6.  [2, 3]                  Yes
    7.  [3]                     Yes
    8.  []                      No

    here we have 3 subsequences(5, 6, 7) those have only prime number(s).
