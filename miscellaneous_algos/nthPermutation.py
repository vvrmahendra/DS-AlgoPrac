"""The set [1,2,3,â€¦,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations. By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, We get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3 ) :
1. "123"
2. "132"
3. "213"
4. "231"
5. "312"
6. "321"
Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence. For example, given n = 3, k = 4, ans = "231""""

Awesome problem. Used "Factorial Number System" like "Decimal Number Systam"
